# ESATAN_PostProcessing

The aim of this project is to provide a tool for fast post-processing of files from ESATAN analyses (\*.TMD).

## Getting Started

The project is written in Matlab and tested on Windows.
Full functionality - including creating reports in tables - is reached with Microsoft Excel installed locally.

To see a demo, please run: `tmd_demo_gsgsat.m` (`GSG_SAT_POLAR.TMD` is read by default).

Thorough instructions and explanations are included in:
- demo file: `tmd_demo_gsgsat.m`,
- inside specific function files.

## Results (demo)

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank everyone who gave me the opportunity to learn Thermal Analysis, as well as those, who encouraged me and helped me with understanding of ESATAN and \*.TMD files.
